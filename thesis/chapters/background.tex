\section{Background}

As the mobile devices become more and more essential for our every day lives, the need for longer and longer battery lives increases. Despite the impact that mobile device battery life has on every day lives of hundreds of millions of people worldwide, the factors which affect a mobile device's battery life have not been studied extensively.        

\subsection{Battery Life of Mobile Devices}
An area of research where mobile device energy consumption has been studied quite a bit, is mobile networking. New mobile networking technologies are being developed constantly and providing faster, more reliable and more energy efficient mobile networking solutions for customers is a profitable business for the internet service providers of the world. Consequently, it is no surprise that funding and research efforts have gravitated towards the field.  

As a concrete example of such research, the impact of using 2G and 3G networks for the mobile phones battery life was compared in \cite{5357972}. The authors used a Nokia N95 phone to test the relative battery consumption of various tasks comparing the results of using GMS, a 2G mobile networking technology and UMTS, a 3G mobile networking technology. The tasks for which the battery consumption was measured included 

\begin{itemize}
\item Sending 50 SMS messages of 100 bytes
\item Downloading 100 megabytes of data
\item Performing a 5 hour voice call 
\end{itemize} 

The conclusion of the study was that different networking technologies are energy efficient in different tasks. While the UMTS network was much more energy efficient for downloading data, the GMS was more energy efficient when sending SMS messages or performing voice calls. The authors argue that this information could be used to minimize energy consumption of mobile phones when multiple networking technologies are available.      

Another perspective from which the mobile device energy consumption has been studied in recent years, is offloading or remote execution of programs. The idea of offloading is simple: since CPU intensive tasks tend to consume a lot of energy, such computing tasks can be executed remotely in a dedicated server or cloud environment. However, transferring data to and from the offloading platform also consumes energy and imposes other constraints such as delay, connectivity, availability, security concerns and potential costs of using such a platform.

One approach to decreasing mobile device energy consumption using computation offloading is given in~\cite{7176219}. In this work, the authors propose a programming model and a runtime environment called Jade for creating processes that are offloading aware. Programs written using their programming model will be subject to custom task scheduling. The scheduler communicates with available computing servers exchanging information about their available computing resources such as the number of CPUs and the amount of RAM to make decisions on where certain tasks should be offloaded to. Upon first execution of each task that uses Jade, the task will be profiled in order to find out if the program is suitable for offloading in future executions. The profiler collects statistics such runtime, energy consumption and size of the task. Whenever a remotable task, that has been profiled, is executed, the Jade environment performs an optimization step where it tries to figure out the optimal way to execute the remotable task. The optimizer estimates the energy consumption of the task for each available offloading server as well as the mobile device itself and chooses the the most host that is estimated to be the most energy efficient for the execution of task.

The authors wrote two applications to evaluate their systems performance. The first program performed facial recognition on photos on the phone chosen by the user. The other program simulated a navigation application by performing Dijkstra's shortest path finding algorithm on a graph. Both applications were run both locally and with offloading enabled. When using offloading, the programs' energy usage was reduced by 34\% and by 39\% respectively. The execution time of the programs was also reduced by 37\% and 45\% respectively.                 

Instead of studying the impact of individual device subsystems such as the network stack on the mobile device's battery life, the work of the Carat group focuses on studying the impact of various system settings and context factors of a mobile device on its energy usage. The approach is based on crowdsourced measurements collected from the users of Carat mobile application. 

In~\cite{PELTONEN201671}, the authors describe a way to model a mobile device's battery life as a function of various context factors and system settings including type, speed and activity of the network that the device was connected to, screen brightness, CPU usage, battery health, voltage and temperature, and the movement of the device. Using conditional mutual information, the model estimates the impact of these factors and variables on the energy consumption of the mobile device. Using this information, they constructed a decision tree based recommendation system called Constella. The Constella application provides the user of a mobile device with recommended actions to increase battery life. The system compares the current values of the context factors and system variables of the device with the model described above, discovering which changes are estimated by the model to save the most battery life. An example of such recommendation could be "Change from mobile to WI-FI network. Expected improvement 33m 33s $\pm$ 57s".
