% tktltiki2 automatically loads babel, so you can simply
% give the language parameter (e.g. finnish, swedish, english, british) as
% a parameter for the class: \documentclass[finnish]{tktltiki2}.
% The information on title and abstract is generated automatically depending on
% the language, see below if you need to change any of these manually.

% Class options:
% - grading                 -- Print labels for grading information on the front page.
% - disablelastpagecounter  -- Disables the automatic generation of page number information
%                              in the abstract. See also \numberofpagesinformation{} command below.
%
% The class also respects the following options of article class:
%   10pt, 11pt, 12pt, final, draft, oneside, twoside,
%   openright, openany, onecolumn, twocolumn, leqno, fleqn
%
% The default font size is 11pt. The paper size used is A4, other sizes are not supported.

\abstract{
Sophisticated mobile devices have rapidly become essential tools for various daily activities of billions of people worldwide. Subsequently, the demand for longer battery lives is constantly increasing. The Carat project is advancing the understanding of mobile energy consumption by using collaborative mobile data to estimate and model energy consumption of mobile devices.          

This thesis presents a method for estimating mobile application energy consumption from mobile device system settings and context factors using association rules. These settings and factors include CPU usage, device travel distance, battery temperature, battery voltage, screen brightness, used mobile networking technology, network type, WiFi signal strength, and WiFi connection speed. The association rules are mined using Apache Spark cluster-computing framework from collaborative mobile data collected by the Carat project. 

Additionally, this thesis presents a prototype of a web based API for discovering these association rules. The web service integrates Apache Spark based analysis engine with a user friendly front-end allowing an aggregated view of the dataset to be accessible without revealing data of individual participants of the Carat project.

This thesis shows that association rules can be used effectively in modelling mobile device energy consumption. Example rules are presented and the performance of the implementation is evaluated experimentally.

% The following can be used to specify keywords and classification of the paper:

\keywords{Data Analysis, Data Mining, Mobile Devices}

% classification according to ACM Computing Classification System (http://www.acm.org/about/class/)
% This is probably mostly relevant for computer scientists
% uncomment the following; contents of \classification will be printed under the abstract with a title
% "ACM Computing Classification System (CCS):"
\classification{
Information systems $\rightarrow$ Information systems applications $\rightarrow$ Data mining $\rightarrow$ Association rules\\
Information systems $\rightarrow$ Information systems applications $\rightarrow$ Mobile information processing systems
}

% If the automatic page number counting is not working as desired in your case,
% uncomment the following to manually set the number of pages displayed in the abstract page:
%
% \numberofpagesinformation{16 pages + 10 appendix pages}
%
% If you are not a computer scientist, you will want to uncomment the following by hand and specify
% your department, faculty and subject by hand:
%
% \faculty{Faculty of Science}
% \department{Department of Computer Science}
% \subject{Computer Science}
%
% If you are not from the University of Helsinki, then you will most likely want to set these also:
%
% \university{University of Helsinki}
% \universitylong{HELSINGIN YLIOPISTO --- HELSINGFORS UNIVERSITET --- UNIVERSITY OF HELSINKI} % displayed on the top of the abstract page
% \city{Helsinki}
